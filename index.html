                <p>A rescue cat is a cat that was surrendered, or found (hence the term "rescued"). An organization will care for and foster the kitty until a forever home adopts him/her/them.<br> Sugar Belle was rescued from a high kill shelter in Kentucky, and Oberon was found inside a tree up North.</p>
