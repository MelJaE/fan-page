            <p>My husband and I have two cats named named Sugar Belle and Oberon.<br> Sugar is a sweet little battle tabby, and Oberon is a cute ball of white fluff with different colored eyes. Both of our cats are rescues.</p>
            <h2>What's a Rescue Cat?</h2>
            <p>A rescue cat is a cat that was surrendered, or found (hence the term "rescued"). An organization will care for and foster the kitty until a forever home adopts him/her/them. Sugar Belle was rescued from a high kill shelter in Kentucky, and Oberon was found inside a tree up North.</p>
